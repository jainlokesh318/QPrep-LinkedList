Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come
before all nodes greater than x. If x is contained within the list, then those nodes need
to be after the elements less than x and before the elements greater than x,
i.e. it should appear between the left and right partitions.

Constraints
1 <= N <= 10^5
|A[i]| <= 10^9

==========
Example 1
==========
Input:
7
3 5 8 5 10 2 1
5

Output:
3 1 2 5 5 10 8

Explanation:
The nodes 3, 1 and 2 are less than 5 so they are present before 10 and 8.
Note:
- There are other possible answers as well like - 3 2 1 5 5 8 10

==========
Example 2
==========
Input:
5
3 1 3 1 4
2

Output:
1 1 4 3 3
