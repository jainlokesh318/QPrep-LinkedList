Write a program to find the node at which the intersection of two singly linked lists begins.

If the linked lists don't have any intersection return NULL
Example - 
3 -> 1 -> 7
            \
             9 -> 15 -> 7
            /
     2 -> 6
    
beginning of intersection = 9

Input
First line contains n, length of first linked list before intersection
Next line contains n space seperated integers.
third line contains m, length of second linked list before intersection
Next line contains m space seperated integers.
fifth line contains k, number of nodes in the common linked list
next line contains k space seperated integers.

Constraints
0 <= N, M, K <= 10^5


Output
print the value of the starting node of the intersection
