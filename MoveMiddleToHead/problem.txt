Given a singly linked list, find middle of the linked list and set middle node of the linked list at beginning of the linked list. 
Note: For even sized LinkedList the middle node will be ( floor(n/2)+ 1)th Node.
For odd sized LinkedList the middle node will be ( floor(n/2)+ 1)th Node.


Constraints
0 <= N <= 10^5
|A[i]| <= 10^9

==========
Example 1
==========
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
3 1 2 4 5

Explanation:
3 is the middle node

==========
Example 2
==========
Input:
6
1 2 3 4 5 6
